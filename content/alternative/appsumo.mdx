## Review, Features

### Appsumo launch worth it?

- My SaaS FeedHive made +300,000 when [launched on AppSumo 2021](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/my-saas-made-400-000-in-its-first-year-heres-how-1649d7bcc7)
- [The 30/100 Split](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/lifetime-deals-and-saas-businesses/#1-the-30100-split) You 30%, Appsumo 20%, Appsumo spend 50% on marketing on other (as they said)
- Consider your lifetime offer a way of letting [early adopters "fund" your product as an alternative to taking investments](https://medium.com/@contact_55742/lifetime-deals-ltds-worth-it-yes-or-no-f97c92054a74).
