## Review, Features

- Can I send marketing emails through MXroute? [Absolutely not.](https://mxroutedocs.com/faq/)

- We support the basic e-mail protocols that you expect. SMTP, IMAP, POP3. We support mail forwarding (aka aliasing), and plus addressing.

- Webmail. We offer Crossbox, Snappy (Rainloop fork), and Roundcube for your choice in webmail.

- IP Reputation. We’ve mostly taken IP reputation off of the table by using a high reputation pool of IP addresses (Click “Start Testing”). If an e-mail fails delivery due to IP reputation, we send again, and again, until we get it right. It’s not your problem and we know that.

- Spam Filtering. We create our own custom SpamAssassin rules based on continual log audits, and we run an internal RBL to fend off the worst spam networks.
